# CTA Train Tracker API

This is a simple wrapper for the CTA Train Tracker API. In order to use this API, you must have a valid API key from the CTA. You can get one [here](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintrackerapply). This project is not affiliated with the CTA in any way.

## Installation

This is a Deno module. You can use it in your project by importing it:

```ts
import { CtaTrainTracker } from "https://deno.land/x/cta/mod.ts";
```
